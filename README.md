## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate large-scale machine learning (ML) techniques in the biomedical field, focusing on self-supervised learning models. It incorporates:
- **Multi-modal Data Integration**: The ability to integrate diverse data types like images, clinical records, and genomic information.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing techniques for distributed systems and performance tuning to handle high-volume datasets.
- **Ethical AI Practices**: Implementing checks for biases in the data and ensuring compliance with ethical AI standards.

The self-supervised learning model is built using PyTorch and TensorFlow and can be deployed in both single-node and distributed environments.
